This is a project to create an advanced note-taking application.

Team Leader: Tyler Ewing

Team Members:
    David Ecker
    Jacob Shaffer
    Matthew Swenson

The original motivation for this project is to make it for iOS or Android tablets and more importantly because of the fact that there are no real good note-taking applications for these platforms.

The application has intuitive features that enhances the user's experience while taking notes for a class, during a meeting, etc.
These features are designed to assist the user without being intrusive or disruptive of workflow.
